Object oriented design patterns exercises
=========================================

This is a listing of repositories where I've written basic programs which illustrate and practice object oriented design patterns.

In my view, there are really only two main areas of knowledge with regards to computers.  The first is the physical representation (in the form of ones and zeros, yes and no, on or off in the machines processors or storage) which actually holds the data, including the commands the machine is to execute.  Everything else is simply patterns, concepts and ideas about how to organize and abstract that physical representation.  Computer languages, programming paradigms, libraries and frameworks are all methods which "translate" the physical representation which the machine understands into something which a human understands.

Design patterns are part of this second area.  Patterns organize code guided by principles in order to make the code easier to write, understand and modify when needed.  They are a very high level of abstraction which can be applied to many situations, independent of language, framework or specific task.  This repo will consist of a collection of links to various other repositories which hold practice examples of patterns that I've written.
